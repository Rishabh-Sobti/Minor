This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

punjab <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\hp\\Documents\\GitHub\\Minor\\combined\\punjab.csv")
library(dplyr)
punjab1 <- punjab %>% select (Name , electricity , treated_water , electronics , 
                               phone , transport)
df1<- punjab1[ , -1 ]
m_dist <- mahalanobis(df1, colMeans(df1), cov(df1))
punjab$MD <- round(m_dist, 1)
summary(punjab$MD)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}

condi<-punjab$MD>= 5.5 
punjab$outlier<- ifelse(condi , 'yes' , 'no')
library(plyr)
count(punjab$outlier)


```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
```{r}
punjab1 <- data.frame(punjab)
removed <- which( punjab1$ outlier =='yes')
punjab1<- punjab1[ -removed , ]
punjab1 <- subset( punjab1, select = -c(outlier ,  MD ) )


```

```{r}
write.csv(punjab1,file='C:\\Users\\hp\\Documents\\GitHub\\Minor\\combined\\punjabnooutliers.csv')

```

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}

```
